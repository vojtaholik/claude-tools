# Minimal scope — no overengineering

Opus 4.5/4.6/4.7 tend to over-deliver: creating extra files, adding abstractions, building in hypothetical flexibility. This prompt keeps them focused.

## Prompt to inject

```
Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused:

- Scope: Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability.

- Documentation: Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change. Only add comments where the logic isn't self-evident.

- Defensive coding: Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs).

- Abstractions: Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task.
```

## Pairs well with

- `vojta-no-hardcode` — ensures solutions are still general, just not over-built
- `vojta-cleanup` — prevents leftover scratch files
